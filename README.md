# Dataset 

We are using the Housing Data Set. It comes orginially from the StatLib library by Carnegie Mellon University based on the article from: 

Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. 
'Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978.

We have obtained it from the UCI Machine Learning repository:
